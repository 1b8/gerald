# Gerald

Hello! This is a Minecraft bot created with
[Mineflayer](https://github.com/andrewrk/mineflayer). It's similar to
[Helperbot](https://github.com/Darthfett/helperbot) and
[rbot](https://github.com/rom1504/rbot). It is **NOT** intended for
cheating! Only use it on servers where you have permission to...

### Installation

Note! The bot requires a username and password for online-mode=true servers.
These can be the credentials of any Minecraft account, but cannot be yours, as
you will need to be online to issue the bot commands. This may be changed in
future.

To use, you must first install (if you don't already have)
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
Click those links, install them, then come back to this page.

Once you've done that, run the following commands in the directory you want to
install Gerald:
```
git clone https://github.com/1b8/gerald.git
cd gerald
npm install
```

Once it's finished downloading files, to use it, perform this command
(in the gerald directory):
```
node gerald.js [host:port] [username|email] [password]
```

Usage documentation can be found... nowhere! Yet!
Say "Bot, show help" in-game to show the help menu...
